# TaskerWallpaperFetcher
2 tasks for Tasker that can fetch and set a wallpaper from Bing or Unsplash. Inspired by https://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/f2taxl/ and https://forum.joaoapps.com/index.php?resources/wallpaper-daily-changer-unsplash-images.417/
## How to use
1. [Download the ZIP](https://github.com/ed789d0/TaskerWallpaperFetcher/archive/main.zip) and extract it. (You can do this directly on your Android device, or on your computer and then transfer the .tsk.xml files.)
2. In Tasker long press the *TASKS* tab at the top and select Import Task.
3. Find the .tsk.xml file you extracted in step 1.
4. The task is now imported.
5. To make it run every day, make a new profile and use the Time option. If you want every day, then make sure the To button is deactivated and select a time to run every day. If you want an interval (up to 12 hours), deactivate both the From and the To buttons and select Every.
